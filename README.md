# Basic Operators with Java

Using a Scanner to get user input for two numbers and then
performing different operations on those numbers and logging
the result.

I also went through the entire list of Java operators and
provided some quick examples of those.


```postfix:	expr++ expr--
unary:	++expr --expr +expr -expr ~ !
multiplicative:	* / %
additive:	+ -
shift:	<< >> >>>
relational:	< > <= >= instanceof
equality:	== !=
bitwise AND:	&
bitwise exclusive OR:	^
bitwise inclusive OR:	|
logical AND:	&&
logical OR:	||
ternary:	? :
assignment:	= += -= *= /= %= &= ^= |= <<= >>= >>>=```
